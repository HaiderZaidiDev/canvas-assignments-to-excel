# canvas-assignments-to-excel
Goes through all of the courses a student is enrolled in on Canvas, and records the assignments and their due dates in a spreadsheet.

## Ideology
I noticed quite a bit of people at my university spent multiple hours going through their Canvas by hand, adding all of their assignments in a spread sheet to help them keep track of what needed to be done. I felt that this process could be automated, so I went ahead and did it.

## Demo
Here's an example of what the spreadsheet looks like with my schedule.
