Logs all your Canvas assignments in a spreadsheet you can sort by date, weight etc. Never miss an assignment again.

Currently live for students at Schulich: https://haiderzaidi.ca/assignment-tracker.

## Ideology
I noticed quite a bit of people at my university spent multiple hours going through their Canvas by hand, adding all of their assignments in a spread sheet to help them keep track of what needed to be done. I felt that this process could be automated, so I went ahead and did it.

## Demo

Here's an example of what the spreadsheet looks like with my schedule.
